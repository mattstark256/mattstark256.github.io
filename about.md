I'm Matt Stark, game developer and creator of Viewfinder. I love making shaders and puzzle games. I started this blog in 2018 as an ongoing portfolio of side projects.

Viewfinder started as a side project while I studied at Abertay University. After a video of the prototype went viral in 2020, I dropped out of university to focus on development.
